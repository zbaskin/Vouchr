# Vouchr

This is an app that will catalog the movies you have seen throughout your life. Furthermore, the user will be able to purchase personalized film tickets to recreate important moments such as a first moviegoing experience. More details to follow. 

## User Interface
This is a very, very early demo of the user interface. In the future, these movies will be displayed as tickets stubs with accompanying graphics.
